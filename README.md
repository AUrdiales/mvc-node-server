# mvc-node-server

This app is a structure for a mvc app with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/ "Node.js") and the frontend responsive framework [materialize](http://www.materializecss.com "materialize").


First of all we need to download Node.js from their webpage, and when we start we are gonna download the packages for this ap with this command:

`npm install`

You will get express, hbs and body-parser.

After this we need to install materialize, the frontend responsive framework with the bower.json with this command.

`bower install`

And now we can start the server and use it as we want as a Model, View, Controller app.
